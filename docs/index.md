## Background

Since its launch in 2019, Grin development was funded by only donations. Donations to [Grin General Fund](https://grin.mw/fund) was controlled by Original Grin Council according to [Grin Governance RFC](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-rfcs/blob/master/text/0002-grin-governance.md). After the last planned hard fork, this RFC has been replaced with [Simplify-Governance RFC](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-rfcs/blob/master/text/0016-simplify-governance.md). Meanwhile community has raised its voice for supporting of more projects extendeding grin and its usability which was heard by Original Grin Council. One of Original Grin Council members, yeastplume made a [proposition](https://gist.github.com/yeastplume/5d1913c7dc40c40f409ffcfe8fa9b094) to split Grin Development Fund, and give control to a second group (or more than one group) for decentralizing governance. After discussions of several different split strategies in governance meetings [²](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-pm/blob/master/notes/20210216-meeting-governance.md) [³](https://github.com/newjack777/grin-pm/blob/master/notes/20210302-meeting-governance.md) and [community](https://forum.grin.mw/t/call-for-grin-community-candidates-for-additional-fund-granting-control/8521), it was decided to split Development Fund into two funds:

* _Grin Development Fund_ to support core grin development
* _Grin Community Fund_ to support community projects

Community Council candidates are called for joining to council, among four of them ( dtavarez, hendi, mcmmike, paouky) were [approved](https://forum.grin.mw/t/call-for-grin-community-candidates-for-additional-fund-granting-control/8521/3?u=stakerv) by original Council. To allow more community participation two additional council members ( anynomous, future3000) are selected only by [votes](https://forum.grin.mw/t/call-for-grin-community-candidates-for-additional-fund-granting-control/8521/13?u=stakerv) of the community. In June 22, the first [community council meeting](https://github.com/grincc/agenda/blob/main/notes/22-06-2021-council-meeting-notes.md) held. In Septemper 20, Grin community Fund [received](https://forum.grin.mw/t/grin-community-council-cc-received-funds-of-33-btc-lets-get-to-work/9247) 33 BTC from original Grin Development Fund, by which splitting of funds has been realized.


## Grin Community Fund

Grin Community fund is initially seeded by splitting a portion of Grin Development Fund. In order to keep independence community fund solely relies on community donations. If you want to keep Grin growing, please consider donation to [Grin Community Fund](https://github.com/grincc/finance/blob/main/addresses.md).


## Today

In 2025, the funds from CC and OC were merged into a single MultiSig wallet, and a new Community Council was introduced: [https://forum.grin.mw/t/introducing-the-new-community-council-cc/11793/14](https://forum.grin.mw/t/introducing-the-new-community-council-cc/11793/14)
