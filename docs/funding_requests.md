# Funding requests


## Summary

In this document we outline the procedure and protocol of handling funding requests. This document serves as a guideline and reference point for Funding Requests applicants, the community and the community council which have to judge and approve these requests. Funding Requests can only be granted upon discussion and an official vote to approve the request in a Grin Community Council meeting (biweekly meetings in [Grin Council](https://t.me/Grin_Governance) telegram group).

## Funding

Funding request can be made in any currency. However, for the ease of discussing we prefer requests are made in major currencies like euros or dollars. We advise to make a funding request in the following format:

- Total amount of funding to be paid upon completion of the project
- Total amount of funding, sub payments to be made upon completion of predefined milestones
- Any other funding model if the applicant can provide good arguments to deviate from the above options

The applicant is advised to open a thread in the Governance section on the Grin forum with all the details about the project.

## Payments

Payments will be made after reviewing the completed project or completed project milestones. Payments will by default be made in BTC unless otherwise requested by the applicant. Payment will be based on the monthly average value equivalent of the requested amount.
